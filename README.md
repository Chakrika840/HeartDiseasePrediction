Heart Disease Prediction 

This project is a Machine Learning-based heart disease prediction system that analyzes patient medical parameters to predict the likelihood of heart disease.

The model is trained using multiple classification algorithms including:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

AdaBoost

Stacking Classifier (Final Ensemble Model)

The system provides real-time predictions through an interactive Gradio web interface.
